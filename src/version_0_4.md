### New version released

Welcome to the [new version of Makefly](${BLOG_URL}/makefly_0.4.zip "Download new Makefly 0.4 version") !

What's new is that - as expected - we use the new ISSO comment system to display comment. We also fixed some minor bugs and delete lua-markdown dependancy so that Makefly could be used on more GNU/Linux distribution (and perhaps BSD systems). 

But what's also new in this version is that we make a [complete documentation on how to create/customize a theme in Makefly](${PROJECTURL}/themes.html "Read more about theme customization in Makefly"). And that's pretty cool!

If you made some template/theme for Makefly, don't forget to share your work so that other users can play with it!

### Next versions

As previous version we will release a 0.4.1 version with next encounted bugs you will find.

For now Makefly is only compatible with Lua 5.1. We planned to migrate to Lua 5.2 with Makefly 0.5 version. If you have any other suggestions, you're welcome!
