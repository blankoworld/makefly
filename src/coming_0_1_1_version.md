# Coming 0.1.1 version

## Introduction

A month ago, [I announce you v0.1 was out](/posts/version_0_1_is_out.html "Read 'Version 0.1 is out!' post").

Today we will see what's next and what expected for future version.

## What's next?

Some functionnalities have been improved or added since 0.1:

  *  Permit user to choose **page ' suffix** (for an example *.html* or *.xhtml*)
  *  Permit user to choose **index filenames** (for an example *index* or *main*)
  *  More **doc**umentation
  *  Some **HTML5 improvements**
  *  Fix some bug
  *  Add a *About*'s page
  *  Templating improvements in order to **create more templates** and cascading stylesheets

And I'm working on some others:

  * Add a **backup command** to save important files from Makefly
  * Add a **publish command** to export Makefly to a server (via rsync and/or ftp)
  * Create a **french** documentation

For **developers** I plan to write a **technical documentation**.

## 0.2 version

What about 0.2 version? I want this version include a comment system. That's why it would happens few weeks before I will achieved this version.

To wait for 0.2 version I suggest you to discover some others functionalities.

## What I plan for undefined version

  * Publish only post that have a date from past to today (but not with a future date)
  * Import script from Nanoblogger to Makefly
  * Import script from Wordpress to Makefly?
  * Permit user to choose sort type for posts
  * Add a search bar to navigation menu
