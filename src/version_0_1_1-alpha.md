## Brief

You can now test [Makefly v0.1.1-alpha](${BASE_URL}/makefly_0.1.1-alpha.zip "Download Makefly v0.1.1-alpha").

The tests behind this alpha version aims to find some problems that could happen by using Makefly.

## More

### Next version 0.1.1

For the next version I expect to finish the developer documentation in order to explain some useful tips and tricks.

Then I will fix some bugs for a beta version of Makefly 0.1.1.

Finally I will possibly add a logo to Makefly.

### Anything else?

I began a [script that imports Nanoblogger posts to Makefly](http://git.dossmann.net/blogbox/nb2makefly.git/ "See more about nb2makely"). I call it **nb2makefly**.

It's pretty dirty, but it works for a lot of [my french weblog](http://olivier.dossmann.net/joueb/ "Discover the BlankoJoueb, a weblog") posts.

I also have to transform Nanoblogger categories to makefly's tags and then import image from Nanoblogger to makefly's static directory.

## Conclusion

I hope this alpha version will be used and that users could send some bugs, improvements, etc.

Have fun with Makefly :-)
