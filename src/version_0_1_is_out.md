# Version 0.1 is out!

I'm glad to announce that [Makefly v0.1](makefly_0.1.zip "Download makefly v0.1 on github") is out!

It contains some interesting functionalities like:

  * RSS feed
  * tags
  * permalink
  * possibility to set posting date (using a _timestamp_)
  * customization using options like max post on homepage
  * translation: English, French
  * static files
  * templates

You can so:

  * create posts
  * add tags to them
  * add image
  * generate an RSS feed
  * give some static files (for an example to share PDF)
  * have your own template
  * translate Makefly in your language

And remember that Makefly is free: use it, copy it, change it, distribute it.
