This new entry seems to be like other one, really? No!

> Why?

Because of **jskomment**. Yes, *jskomment comment system is the new Makefly comment system*.

But it is only available in trunk version. It will be included into Makefly 0.2 soon.

To have more info about jskomment, go to the [jskomment official website](http://code.google.com/p/jskomment/ "Go to the jskomment project official website").

We also have integrated a system that permit to show your **statusnet** status via [ELI (Expression Libre Identica)](https://github.com/blankoworld/eli "More info about ELI").

Don't hesitate to test them an return your opinion, bug, ideas, etc.
