Just remember one address for last news: [${PROJECTURL}](${PROJECTURL}blog "Visit official weblog to have news about ${PROJECTNAME}!").

I will post some tips & tricks, news and event about the project here. For this, I could use some example like this to be changed in a file:

<pre name="code" class="Bash">
    YOURVAR = the content of your variable
</pre>

But those who prefer to be more connected, I suggest you [to follow Makefly social network group](https://status.vinilox.eu/group/makefly).
