### Version 0.3 will be late

I scheduled the next version for to October, the 31st.

This is for some reasons:

  * I do not finish all tickets
  * I'm busy with some other tasks
  * As I'm the only developer/user on Makefly, it take some times to see bug, fix problems, etc.

But hey, we just have 2 tickets to finish before the next version!

### I'm not patient

If you're not patient, [take a tour to the next version bÃªta 1 release](${BLOG_URL}/makefly_0.3b1.zip) ([french makefly version](${BLOG_URL}/makefly_0.3b1_fr.zip)).

Have a nice day with Makefly ;)
