## Brief

[0.2 alpha version is out](${BLOG_URL}/makefly_0.2-alpha.zip "Download last 0.2-alpha version") !

Use it and [report bug](https://github.com/blankoworld/makefly/issues/new "Report a Makefly's bug") if you find anyone.

## Give me more info

Some useful functionnality have been added as:

  * a comment system
  * a badge that permit to show identica's statuses
  * new theme (called [responsive from initializr.com](http://www.initializr.com/try "Demo for Responsive theme from initializr"))
  * some tests on [devtools branch](https://gitorious.org/makefly/devtools "See makefly-devtools branch") to quickly test Makefly's consistency

Of course I fixed some bugs and improve some elements as translation, documentation, appearance, etc.

## Next event

As last alpha version we will create a bÃªta version then a final version Makefly 0.2. Note that Makefly 0.2 is scheduled for April, the 17th (2013).

I hope Makefly 0.2 alpha version will correspond to all your expectations!
