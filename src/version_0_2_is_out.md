## New version

During three last months was integrated some functionalities in Makefly:

* Comment system for your web readers
* Statuses from identica
* New themes: "responsive", "base" and "bootstrap"
* Permit to add an introduction and/or a footer without changing templates
* Improve documentation appearance
* Add a command to create its own theme

Of course I fix some bugs and do minimalist improvements on backups, documentation and translations.

You can so [download Makefly v0.2](${BASE_URL}/makefly_0.2.zip "Download Makefly v0.2") now.

## Next

Next version will be 0.2.1. I foresee to plan 0.3 version next 6 weeks to define new functionnality and improvements.
