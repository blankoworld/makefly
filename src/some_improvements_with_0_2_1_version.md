### Improvements

Two last months 2 users accept to test occasionnaly Makefly. For me it was an huge progression. Having users that return you bugs, criticism, improvements, wish, etc. is excellent!

I so improve themes, documentation, add some commands to simplify Makefly's use (even it's not planned to be used by a "normal" user), etc.

That's why today [Makefly v0.2.1](${BLOG_URL}/makefly_0.2.1.zip) is out with these improvements.

### Plan for next 0.3 release

0.3 version is planned to introduce some Lua scripts that permit to improve generation time and permit to add new functionnalities to Makefly.

I begin a Lua script and result are promising. For an example, to create 1000 posts with Makefly 0.2.1, it takes 6min21. With Lua scripts, it takes 1min50.

What should permit Lua is:

  * Create a plugin system for Makefly
  * Add meta keyword for each page
  * Sort homepage posts
  * Add an archive page
  * Create multiple RSS feeds
  * Change RSS factory to take less time to generate only 8 items
  * Add smileys
  * etc.

Hope you will enjoy playing with Makefly and that you will give some ideas to improve next Makefly versions ;-)
