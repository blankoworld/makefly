## Brief

The last [0.3-bÃªta2 version](${BLOG_URL}/makefly_0.3b2.zip) is now available !

I add some improvements as:

  * a special directory in which you can add specific pages
  * generate 2 versions of Makefly. Normal one and french one.
  * a better translation support
  * split post list page
  * add keywords functionnalities
  * support only 2 themes: base and minisch one
  * improve documentation in the code (for developers)
  * change from bash to Lua some scripts
  * migrate from BASE_URL to BLOG_URL
  * fix some bugs

This is not a lot of improvements but I'm very busy!

## Next weeks

For the next weeks I want to test Makefly v0.3b2 and check if all is OK in a production environment.

I have no very hard work to do on next releases because this version seems to be useful and workable.

But what I want next is:

  * using Lua as command system instead of Makefile
  * do translation about this command system
  * see what's possible for GUI on Makefly as web administration tool and/or gtk/qt/other? gui tool

## Conclusion

I hope you will have fun with Makefly and continue to use it and to report bug if encounted.
