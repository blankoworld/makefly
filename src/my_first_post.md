### Welcome to Makefly

Hi, nice to meet you. I'm your first post. I'm here to give you some links and explanation to understand how to use Makefly.

Are you ready?

### Manage posts

A post can be created using the following command:

    makefly add

Just give some response and it will be OK.

You probably want to delete this post which appears first on your blog. But read it first before ;)

To delete the post delete 2 files:

  * ./db/1452629704,my\_first\_post.mk
  * ./src/my\_first\_post.md

To complete your knowledge about writing posts, I suggest you to have a look at [Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) that is used for each post.

You can also [follow Markdown Interactive Tutorial](http://markdowntutorial.com/).

### If any problemâ€¦

Just have a look on [official documentation](http://makefly.depotoi.re/documentation.html) where you will probably find the solution.

If you really don't find, either contact me at [olivier [AT] dossmann [DOT] net](olivier+makefly@dossmann.net) or [ask about help by opening a new ticket on Github](https://github.com/blankoworld/makefly/issues).

### Let's go!

What do you wait for? Let's go writing posts!
