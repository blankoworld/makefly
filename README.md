## Dependencies

Some programs on which makefly depends: 

  * pmake or bmake

## Installation

No need to install it. But after generation, perhaps would you install result in a specific directory?

You should so use **create_post.sh** which is a bash shell script. Just launch it:

    bash create_post.sh

## Configuration

The first time you use Makefly you don't have any configuration file. An example is available in *makefly.rc.example*. Copy it to **makefly.rc** to permit Makefly to work.

For more information please read **The makefly.rc configuration file** section.
