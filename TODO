- Add sidebar.md in special directory in order to be displayed on Makefly
- permit to add META data into db files in order to be added in "head" section of HTML files (for META tags)
- Instead of copying each file from static, just copy all static directory content (cp static/* ./pub)
- Instead of copying each file given in THEME_STATIC_FILES, just copy those given in template/theme_name/static directory
- Create a list of error that you can encount and give some explanations to fix them
- Add in doc some explanation on how makefly work for src, db directory and linked files.
- Only permit to publish current post (if post have a date in the future, so don't take it)
- Permit user to create a cron that publish posts each day?
- Create a [b|p]make publish in order to publish blog with a specific script

- Create a [b|p]make refreshall to clean all files, recompile them and publish blog
- Permit to choose if we want reversed list of article or not (sort by date or DESC sort)
- Permit something like "share this article on identi.ca" (Cf. http://www.vinilox.eu/blog/2012/07/06/jappix-est-il-encore-un-projet-libre/)
- Create a nanoblogger import script to migrate from Nanoblogger to Makefly
- Other import script? From Wordpress to Makefly?
- Add Search capability on home page
- Permit to integrate makefly blog in another website? From an example begin from an homepage then click on "blog" and have makefly weblog? => this should be done via theme/css?
- Use double $ to give parser the content of posts, for an example ${parser} CONTENT=$$()

- Change all s/ABCD/abcd to tr "[A-Z]" "[a-z]"
- Add anchor to join content's page on EACH page
- permit user to select how many lines should be given for each articles on index page (for an example 10 lines): to do this, do a head -n 10 on art1.md then do markdown on it
- permit user to choose if yes or no it wants "how many lines" to be used or not in Makefly
- create a Makefile that permit user to setup and install makefly (this permit to return an error if a program is missing)
  - permit to change language regarding LOCALE (makefly.rc.example configuration)
  - permit to setup programs like sed, bash/zsh, etc. or return an error if no one exists

IDEAS:
------

- plugins
- comments
- rss/atom feeds
- smileys
- sitemap (xml/html)
- fortunes
- identica'status
- find a logo
- do a favicon with logo
- template:
  - permit template like Nanoblogger or Utterson. For an example with m4 or with this:
    eval "cat << ___EOF___
    $(cat)
    ___EOF___"
    This permit to replace some variables. It's seems to be not valid without zsh.
  - templating (PEG system with POSIX compatibility, like byacc [Berkeley YACC])

DONE:
-----

- permit to sort article regarding a given timestamp (add timestamp to db/ files).
  Example : date -d "2012-06-04 00:15:32" +'%s' to have timestamp at 2012-06-etc.
  date +%s give current timestamp
  File example : timestampnumber,article_title.mk
- rss feed
- simple templating system
- add X articles on index page where X is in makefly.rc
- do something not to destroy makefly.rc configuration. For an example an makefly.rc.example
- permalink
- some translations
- permit user to select which format the date should have
- change template for each post (in order to have date and permalink)
- Add "tag(s)" before tags on posts'footer
- categories/tags:
  .for ARTICLE in ${ARTICLES}
  .for TAG in ${TAGS}
  TAG_${TAG} += ${ARTICLE}
  .endfor
  .endfor
- create a documentation in markdown and add a target in Makefile to create .html doc :)
- write a doc
- create a script that generate some posts and delete current posts (except an example post?)
- Add a parser_opts to parser in order to give it some VAR. Example : ${parser} ${parse_opts} and parse_opts = "VAR=content VAR2=content2"
- Change colors from links (a better gray or another color)
- Permit user to have images (copy all files from src, except .md files)
- add a license (for an example BSD)
- complete README.md
- Permit user to choose FILE EXTENSION for all files
- Make possibility to have a "About" page (kind of static webpage). Perhaps with a about.md?
- Add POSTDIR_NAME and TAGDIR_NAME to documentation in order to inform user that he can change that
- Add more installation element in documentation
- Change "github" source link to "gitorious" source link
- Permit to create more templates with linked CSS
- Permit THEME_STATIC_FILES to be copied from template/theme to pub directory (from config.mk given on each template
- Create a [b|p]make backup to save all important files in a 20120822_13H44_makefly_archive.tar.gz (for an example):
  * makefly.rc
  * static directory
  * special directory
  * db directory
- Create a french documentation
- Integrate another theme like minisch (from schoewilliam)?
- Create a template for tag list with some text (in order to be more readeable in elinks)
- Use posts'title for each individual page and homepage. For an example to have "My first post" then content of post
