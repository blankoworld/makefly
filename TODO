TODO:
-----

- Use double $ to give parser the content of posts, for an example ${parser} CONTENT=$$()
- use : ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/pkgsrc-2012Q2/pkgsrc/Makefile to discover if/else/end in bsd makefile
- complete README.md
- change all variable to be UNIQUE in TEMPLATES
- Change all s/ABCD/abcd to tr "[A-Z]" "[a-z]"
- Use posts'title for each individual page and homepage. For an example to have "My first post" then content of post
- Create a template for tag list with some text (in order to be more readeable in elinks)
- Add anchor to join content's page on EACH page
- permit user to select how many lines should be given for each articles on index page (for an example 10 lines): to do this, do a head -n 10 on art1.md then do markdown on it
- permit user to choose if yes or no it wants "how many lines" to be used or not in Makefly
- plugins
- comments
- rss/atom feeds
- smileys
- sitemap (xml/html)
- fortunes
- identica'status
- find a logo
- do a favicon with logo
- template:
  - permit template like Nanoblogger or Utterson. For an example with m4 or with this:
    eval "cat << ___EOF___
    $(cat)
    ___EOF___"
    This permit to replace some variables. It's seems to be not valid without zsh.
  - templating (PEG system with POSIX compatibility, like byacc [Berkeley YACC])
- create a Makefile that permit user to setup and install makefly (this permit to return an error if a program is missing)
  - permit to change language regarding LOCALE (makefly.rc.example configuration)
  - permit to setup programs like sed, bash/zsh, etc. or return an error if no one exists

DONE:
-----

- permit to sort article regarding a given timestamp (add timestamp to db/ files).
  Example : date -d "2012-06-04 00:15:32" +'%s' to have timestamp at 2012-06-etc.
  date +%s give current timestamp
  File example : timestampnumber,article_title.mk
- rss feed
- simple templating system
- add X articles on index page where X is in makefly.rc
- do something not to destroy makefly.rc configuration. For an example an makefly.rc.example
- permalink
- some translations
- permit user to select which format the date should have
- change template for each post (in order to have date and permalink)
- Add "tag(s)" before tags on posts'footer
- categories/tags:
  .for ARTICLE in ${ARTICLES}
  .for TAG in ${TAGS}
  TAG_${TAG} += ${ARTICLE}
  .endfor
  .endfor
- create a documentation in markdown and add a target in Makefile to create .html doc :)
- write a doc
- create a script that generate some posts and delete current posts (except an example post?)
- Add a parser_opts to parser in order to give it some VAR. Example : ${parser} ${parse_opts} and parse_opts = "VAR=content VAR2=content2"
- Change colors from links (a better gray or another color)
- Permit user to have images (copy all files from src, except .md files)
- add a license (for an example BSD)
