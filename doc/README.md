# ${PROJECTNAME}

[Version fran√ßaise](${PROJECTURL}documentation.html.fr) (French original version)

[Official website](${PROJECTURL} "Go to the website")

## Description

${PROJECTNAME} is a fast and lightweight command line static weblog engine which uses the [Markdown format](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax "Discover the Markdown format") for post writting and rendering.

It consists in a homepage, a post list, a tag list and an about's page.

It gives these functionnalities:

  * themes
  * RSS feed
  * keywords on each page (for web ranking)
  * tags
  * static webpages
  * predate posts
  * translations
  * comment system
  * backup
  * publishing scripts to remote servers
  * quick theme creation
  * Nanoblogger posts migration (Cf. **Migrate from Nanoblogger** section)

**Note** : ${PROJECTNAME} was not designed to create, edit and delete posts. Even if it offers a script that make new post we suggest you to turn to other projects like [Hymby](https://github.com/blankoworld/hymby) (in development).

## Installation

### Briefly

In some short steps, here is how to install the last version (current development):

    sudo apt-get install lua5.1 lua-filesystem
    curl ${GITPROJECT}archive/master.zip
    unzip master.zip
    cd makefly-master
    cp ${PROJECTNAMELOWER}.rc.example ${PROJECTNAMELOWER}.rc
    ./${PROJECTNAMELOWER} clean && ./${PROJECTNAMELOWER} compile

You should have an action list done on your computer. And result is available in **pub directory**.

### Detailed

If you achieve the **Briefly** step, go to **Use it!** section.

#### Dependencies

Some programs on which ${PROJECTNAME} depends: 

  * lua 5.1 and earlier
  * lua-filesystem

So use your distribution package manager to install them. For an example on Debian and derivated, it would be:

    apt-get install lua5.1 lua-filesystem

For other distribution, please have a look on your distribution's forum/IRC/community. They will enjoy helping you.

#### Others methods to install dependancies

If your distribution doesn't have *lua-filesystem*, you can attempt to install **luarocks** then install dependancies as:

    sudo apt-get install luarocks
    luarocks install lua-filesystem

That's all!

#### Installation

There is 2 ways to install ${PROJECTNAME} on your computer:

  * [current development version](${GITPROJECT}archive/master.zip "Download current development version")
  * [0.3 stable version (recommanded)](${PROJECTURL}${PROJECTNAMELOWER}_0.3.zip "Download 0.3 stable version")

So you just have to:

  * fetch the choosen version
  * extract the content in a directory on your computer

And ${PROJECTNAME} is installed.

#### Configuration

##### Stable version

No special configuration required. Check that **${PROJECTNAMELOWER}.rc** file is present. Otherwise copy **${PROJECTNAMELOWER}.rc.example** file or rename it to **${PROJECTNAMELOWER}.rc**.

##### Trunk version

The first time you use ${PROJECTNAME} you don't have any configuration file. An example is available in *${PROJECTNAMELOWER}.rc.example*. Copy it to **${PROJECTNAMELOWER}.rc** to permit ${PROJECTNAME} to work.

##### More info

For more information please read **The ${PROJECTNAMELOWER}.rc configuration file** section.

## Use it!

**By default the content of the blog is located in the pub directory**.

### In brief

Some useful commands:

  * **./${PROJECTNAMELOWER} compile**: Produce the blog. Available in the **pub** directory
  * **./${PROJECTNAMELOWER} help**: Display available commands
  * **./${PROJECTNAMELOWER} add**: Create a post and add its main metadata
  * **./${PROJECTNAMELOWER} clean**: Trash the entire final directory content and empty the ${PROJECTNAME}'s *cache*.

### Create content

#### Create a new post

Use this command:

    ./${PROJECTNAMELOWER} add

and answer to all given questions. It will generate some files needed by ${PROJECTNAME}.

Note that ${PROJECTNAME} use the [markdown format](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Learn more about Markdown format") for its posts.

**Don't forget to edit the file that the './${PROJECTNAMELOWER} add' command return.**

#### Static content (pictures, videos, PDF files, etc.)

Sometimes you want to share some files as photos, demonstration, shows, etc. *static* directory exists for this kind of use. Each file that is in this directory will be copied in the result directory.

Example:

  * We created *static/makefly.svg* file
  * After blog's compilation: *pub/makefly.svg* file exists

It works for each kind of file in this *static* directory.

#### Static pages

Sometimes you'd prefer to add **static** pages,  for an example legal notices.

For this, create **pages** directory in the ${PROJECTNAME}'s root. Then add some files that contains Markdown content with **.md** file extension.

Example:

  * We created *pages/notices.md* file
  * After blog's compilation: *pub/mentions.html* file exists

This allow you to create a website with static pages.

Note 1: Page result's name will be in lower case and will replace spaces with underscore (*_* char).

Note 2: No dynamic link will be make to static page. You will need to modify template yourself to include a link to the static page. Cf. *Template ' structure* section.

#### The 'special' directory

This one is named **special** because it can contain some file you have to create in order to activate a functionality:

  * *about.md* : Is the content of an about's page about your website. It will add an item in the website main menu (If your theme support it.)
  * *sidebar.md* : Add a sidebar on your website. The theme have to support this function.
  * *introduction.md* : Display this file's content as an introduction on all your website's pages. This could change regarding the choosen theme.
  * *footer.md* : Display this file's content as a footer on all your website's pages. This could change regarding the choosen theme.

### Produce the blog

After having created *${PROJECTNAMELOWER}.rc* (from ${PROJECTNAMELOWER}.rc.example) and having created some posts, just do this:

    ./${PROJECTNAMELOWER} compile

It will generate a ${PROJECTNAME} weblog to the **pub** directory (default directory).

## Publish result to the web

The result is compatible with all HTML servers. In fact you could probably use result with your website provider. You just have to upload all files from **pub** directory to your provider's web directory.

### From a webserver

If you launch ${PROJECTNAME} on you own server or probably on provider ' server, you should be capable to use **install** script automation. Just launch it as:

    ./${PROJECTNAMELOWER} install

...and it will copy all files to **~/public\_html** directory.

**WARNING**: This will erase all files from *public\_html* directory!

**Note**: You can customize the destination by changing **${PROJECTNAMELOWER}.rc** file espacially the given line : 

    INSTALLDIR=${HOME}/public_html

Then relaunch `./${PROJECTNAMELOWER} refresh && ./${PROJECTNAMELOWER} install` to recompile and reinstall the weblog.

### To a remote computer: *publish* command

To publish your blog to a remote computer you have to:

  * have an SSH access to the remote machine
  * have rsync program
  * configure **PUBLISH\_DESTINATION** in **${PROJECTNAMELOWER}.rc** file
  * launch **publish** command

That's all!

Note that **PUBLISH\_DESTINATION** looks like:

    myRemoteUser@remoteDomain.tld:/myhomedirectory/public_dir

Once having complete this variable in **${PROJECTNAMELOWER}.rc** file, just launch:

    ./${PROJECTNAMELOWER} publish

For developers: You can also edit **tools/publish.sh** file and change script content to you own code.

## Create a new theme

To make easier the theme creation you can use this command:

    ./${PROJECTNAMELOWER} theme myTheme

where **myTheme** is to replace by your own theme name.

Note: This exploits a theme called *Base* as example.

For template designer have a look here: [Themes documentation](${PROJECTURL}/themes.html.en "Read more about making template for ${PROJECTNAME}").

## Translation

A simple way to translate ${PROJECTNAME} to your language is to copy the **lang/translate.en** file to another translation file. For an example, for french (with fr code), you can copy **lang/translate.en** to **lang/translate.fr** and change values. Then just change *BLOG\_LANG* option in **${PROJECTNAMELOWER}.rc** file.

## Backup

Perhaps would you backup some important files in ${PROJECTNAME}? It's possible via **backup command**. Just launch it like this:

    ./${PROJECTNAMELOWER} backup

Requirements:

  * tar
  * gzip

Files saved:

  * ${PROJECTNAMELOWER}.rc
  * static directory
  * special directory
  * db directory
  * src directory
  * the directory that contains the choosen theme (for an example *templates/default/*)

Result: This will create a *tarball* named *YYYYmmdd-HM\_${PROJECTNAMELOWER}.tar.gz* in **mbackup** directory (for an example 20120823-1732\_${PROJECTNAMELOWER}.tar.gz). You can so backup your ${PROJECTNAME} each day for an example.

### Tip

You can customize (in your **${PROJECTNAMELOWER}.rc** file):

  * the backup directory by using **BACKUPDIR** option
  * the prefix of the name by using **BACKUP\_PREFIX** option
  * the suffix of the name by using **BACKUP\_SUFFIX** option
  * the date format using **BACKUP\_FORMAT** option

## Play with the command line

Knowing that ${PROJECTNAME} works the following way:

    ./${PROJECTNAMELOWER} help

and use some configuration file as **config** and **${PROJECTNAMELOWER}**.rc, we can play with some variables.

For an example:

    LANG=fr_FR.UTF-8 ./${PROJECTNAMELOWER} help

Which permits to change the output language in French.

This way you have the following variables:

  * CURDIR : ${PROJECTNAME} directory path. Permit to launch compilation from another directory. By default the current directory.
  * LANGDIR : directory path that contains translations. By default the **lang** directory from current path.
  * LANG : language used by the command line. For an example **en_US.UTF-8** of **fr_FR.UTF-8**.
  * CONFIG : default ${PROJECTNAME} configuration file path. By default the **config** from current directory.
  * RC_CONFIG : user's configuration file path. By default the **${PROJECTNAMELOWER}**.rc from current directory.

All these params will permit you to create scripts using ${PROJECTNAME}.

## Sources

Sources are available: 

  * [On github](${GITPROJECT})

## Documentation

This file is the documentation. You can [read it on github](${GITPROJECT} "Read documentation on Github") or simply generate an HTML file with this command:

    ./${PROJECTNAMELOWER} doc

## Tips

### Write post ahead of current's datetime

In ${PROJECTNAME} you can publish early posts. To do that metadata file should have a timestamp superior to current's one when you generate the weblog. 

For an example we are 2013, the 6th march. 12:30:00. The timestamp is : 1362569400. Your post (situated in the **db** directory) have to have a timestamp inferior to current's one (1362569400).

### Write directly the post's content during its creation

Just use the 'content' variable at the beginning of the command:

    content="my little content" ./${PROJECTNAMELOWER} add

This will add "my little content" into your new post.

### Having a comment system

${PROJECTNAME} have a free beta service called [Rave Comment](http://rave.depotoi.re/) and available for users.

Once registered, you will receive an URL as: **rave.depotoi.re/mypseudo**.

You just have to edit ${PROJECTNAMELOWER}.rc and change these variables:

    ISSO = 1
    ISSO_URL = rave.depotoi.re/mypseudo

You will so have a comment system on your website.

Note: comments will not be visible on your computer. Only on remote website.

### [deprecated] Do not lost comments when migrating from an old domain to a new one

**Note**: This tip is **deprecated** since 0.4 ${PROJECTNAME} version as it only works with JSKOMMENT system.

When you migrate from **old.domain.tld** to **new.domain.tld**, comments will not appear.

To avoid this problem, just use **migratefrom command** as:

    ./${PROJECTNAMELOWER} migratefrom http://old.domain.tld

This will update all your old posts with the old comments' identifier (your old domain) and comments will afressh appear.

## The ${PROJECTNAMELOWER}.rc configuration file
