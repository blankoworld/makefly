# About

## What's Makefly ?

Makefly is a static weblog engine working thanks to a BSD makefile under GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL).

It's composed of:

* home page
* post's list
* tag's list

and includes somes functionalities like:

* RSS feed
* tags
* permalink
* possibility to set posting date (using a timestamp)
* customization using options like max post on homepage
* translation: English, French
* static files
* templates

You can so:

* create posts
* add tags to them
* add image
* generate an RSS feed
* give some static files (for an example to share PDF)
* have your own template
* translate Makefly in your language

In fact, it's a lightweight weblog engine that generates some HTML static files.

## No UI?

Makefly aims to do a thing and do it well. It's not user-friendly so you cannot easily add posts. To do this, you need a UI (User Interface) that Makefly's project don't get. But [BlogBox project (fr)](http://blogbox.e-mergence.org "Learn more on BlogBox project") wants to do this soon (approximatively 2013, March).

If you are interested by an UI, perhaps would you be available for:

  * creating pictures that show a web interface
  * testing Makefly to explain what is missing
  * developing a lightweight web interface for Makefly
  * giving you opinion about Makefly
  * explain what you expect about a weblog administration panel
