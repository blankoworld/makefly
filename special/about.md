# About

## What's Makefly ?

Makefly is a static weblog engine working thanks to a BSD makefile under GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL).

It's composed of:

* home page
* post's list
* tag's list
* [optional] about's page

and includes somes functionalities like:

* RSS feed
* tags
* permalink
* possibility to set posting date (using a timestamp)
* customization using options like max post on homepage
* translation: English, French
* static files
* templates
* comment system
* identica badge (to display twitter/identica statuses)
* backup command
* publish command
* theme creation command

You can so:

* create posts
* add tags to them
* add image
* generate an RSS feed
* give some static files (for an example to share PDF)
* have your own template
* translate Makefly in your language
* prepare some post and publish them in the future
* add comments on each post
* add an about page, an introduction on main page and/or a specific footer content
* display your identica statuses in sidebar
* backup your configuration file, theme, static files and some important files for your Makefile blog
* publish your blog on the web
* create your own theme

In fact, it's a lightweight weblog engine that generates some HTML static files.

## Themes

Have a look to [Themes list for v0.2](${BLOG_URL}/${POSTDIR_NAME}/theme_list_v0_2.html). Hope you will find a theme you like.

## No UI?

Makefly aims to do a thing and do it well. It's not user-friendly so you cannot easily add posts. To do this, you need a UI (User Interface) that Makefly's project don't get. But [BlogBox project (fr)](http://blogbox.depotoi.re "Learn more on BlogBox project") wants to do this soon (approximatively 2013, March).

If you are interested by an UI, perhaps would you be available for:

  * creating pictures that show a web interface
  * testing Makefly to explain what is missing
  * developing a lightweight web interface for Makefly
  * giving you opinion about Makefly
  * explain what you expect about a weblog administration panel
