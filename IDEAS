# IDEAS

Here is some ideas that I have during project's development.

## Projects

- hymby : Host Your MiniBlog Yourself for static blog engine (hymby) + Lua interface
- Another Naughty Static Weblog Engine Response = ANSWER

## Comment system

- how could we add comments on each post? Disqus @ begining, then which system? => Lua system with a DB?
- talkatv as comment system

## Tests results

- makefly v1.1-bêta: 3H47 for processing 18251 posts
- makefly v1.1-bêta: 2min when using clean method

## Branchs

- devtools: with /tools and /tests to give developers some tools to recreate posts, and some tests to see if nothing is broken. Give also DEV documentation contained in doc/DEV.README.*
- extras: with /templates (more templates than default one) and /bin with lunamark and markdown.md

## Others

- For geek or console user, we could do an interface to simplify files creation. With Lua, lambda users could create files quickly and without any knowledge.
- permit to add an introduction
- permit to add plugins?
- atom feeds
- HTML verification?
- use more LUA to parse and create public files
- generate a xml.gz for web robots
