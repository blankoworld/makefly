# IDEAS

Here is some ideas that I have during project's development.

## Projects

- hymby : Host Your MiniBlog Yourself for static blog engine (hymby) + Lua interface
- Another Naughty Static Weblog Engine Response = ANSWER

## Comment system

- how could we add comments on each post? Disqus @ begining, then which system? => Lua system with a DB?

## Tests results

- makefly v0.1.1-bêta: 3H47 for processing 18251 posts
- makefly v0.1.1-bêta: 2min when using clean method
- makefly v0.2-trunk: 6min21.71 sec for processing 1000 posts
- makefly v0.2-luaversion: 1min50.74 for processing 1000 posts
- makefly v0.2-luaversion: ~ 42min for processing 18251 posts

## Others

- For geek or console user, we could do an interface to simplify files creation. With Lua, lambda users could create files quickly and without any knowledge.
- permit to add plugins?
- atom feeds
- HTML verification?
- use more LUA to parse and create public files. Use ROPE: http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaRopes and http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~lhf/ftp/lua/5.1/lrope.tar.gz
- generate a xml.gz for web robots

## Old ones

- ABANDON | talkatv as comment system

### Branchs

- DONE | devtools: with /tools and /tests to give developers some tools to recreate posts, and some tests to see if nothing is broken. Give also DEV documentation contained in doc/DEV.README.*
- DONE | extras: with /templates (more templates than default one) and /bin with lunamark and markdown.md
